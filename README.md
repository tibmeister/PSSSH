PSSSH
=====
This is a PowerShell library and module to implement an SSH/SCP/SFTP client usable from PowerShell. This uses the Renci.SSHClient library (http://sshnet.codeplex.com/), and the Ionic.Zlib library (https://github.com/jstedfast/Ionic.Zlib). I have to give credit to the POSH-SSH project (https://github.com/darkoperator/Posh-SSH) for insperation and the ability to learn how to create PowerShell snapins using C#.

For convenience, and for those who need to see the code before running anything, I have built a basic build.bat file which will allow you to download the repo, and execute the build.bat file to compile this WITHOUT needing Visual Studio, SharpDevelop, etc.  All you need is .NET 3.5 and PowerShell 2.

To install this module, place it either in the System PoewrShell Modules directory, or in your User PowerShell Modules Repository.  Then, simply run "Import-Module PSSSH".
