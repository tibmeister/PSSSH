PSSSH
=====
This is a PowerShell library and module to implement an SSH/SCP/SFTP client usable from PowerShell. This uses the Renci.SSHClient library (http://sshnet.codeplex.com/), and the Ionic.Zlib library (https://github.com/jstedfast/Ionic.Zlib). I have to give credit to the POSH-SSH project (https://github.com/darkoperator/Posh-SSH) for insperation and the ability to learn how to create PowerShell snapins using C#.
